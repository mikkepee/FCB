# FCB

Some playing around with football data, focusing on mathces of FC Barcelona. Some parts are done for school projects. The used tools are R and Rjags.

The file FootballEurope.csv is the 'original' data set from Kaggle. With codes in datamanage.rmd I have done a new data set which includes all mathes of one team (FC Barcelona but could be done for other teams also). Then using this data set and codes in fcb-poisson.rmd and goalcount(1-4).bug are done some Bayesian data analysis. Things until here are done for a project of a Bayesian Analysis course (spring 2018) in Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya Facultat de Matemàtiques i Estadìstica.

The rest I did to learn things about the flexdashboard in R. The result can be seen in the file fcb.rmd. For this I did one more data set which has information about matches of FC Barcelona arranged by the opponents. The data set is in the file fcbopponents.csv and the codes in the file opponentcode.r. The aim here was actually not to make the most informative and pretty dashboard but to try how different things work.
